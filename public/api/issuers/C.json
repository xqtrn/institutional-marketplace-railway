The partially state-owned company was China's top-performing stock of 2024, surging 383% to reach a $41 billion market cap - outpacing even Nvidia and TSMC in percentage gains. Listed on the Shanghai STAR Market in 2020, Cambricon achieved its first quarterly profit in Q4 2024, projecting 70% revenue growth to 1.2 billion yuan. The company's 7-nanometer AI chips have positioned it as China's domestic answer to US chip restrictions, benefiting from government pressure on Chinese companies to adopt local alternatives to Nvidia processors. In 2024, Cambricon's stock breached the 1,000 yuan mark, a psychological threshold matched only by Kweichow Moutai in A-share history.",

CMT's DriveWell Fusion platform gathers sensor data from smartphones, connected vehicles, dashcams, and IoT devices to detect distracted driving, crashes, and risky behaviors. The company's 2024 Road Risk Report revealed an 8.6% decline in distracted driving - the largest drop in five years - helping prevent an estimated 55,000 crashes and $2.2 billion in economic damages annually. CMT earned Frost & Sullivan's 2024 Market Leadership Award for innovations in telematics insurance and connected claims.",

Founded in 2013 by Dr. Joseph DeSimone and team, the company combines molecular science with hardware and software to create industrial 3D printers capable of producing end-use parts at scale. Carbon's breakthrough partnership with Adidas produced the first mass-manufactured 3D printed midsoles in the Futurecraft 4D and subsequent 4DFWD lines. The platform serves industries including footwear, automotive, dental, and consumer products with a subscription-based business model.",

Headquartered in El Segundo, California, the company is developing Blackbeard, the first U.S. hypersonic system engineered from inception for industrial-rate output and commercial unit cost. In 2025, Castelion conducted more than 20 development flight tests and secured contracts from the U.S. Army and Navy for platform integration. The company is building Project Ranger, a 1,000-acre solid rocket motor manufacturing facility in New Mexico capable of producing thousands of Blackbeard missiles per year. Castelion raised $450 million including a $350 million Series B in December 2025.",

In August 2024, Google executed a $2.7 billion 'reverse acqui-hire' deal, licensing Character.AI's technology while bringing back Shazeer and 30+ researchers. The company continues operating independently under new CEO Karandeep Anand, with 250% subscriber growth on its c.ai+ premium tier.",

Backed by SoftBank Vision Fund with nearly $4 billion in total funding, Chehaoduo has grown to become a comprehensive automotive services platform offering vehicle inspections, financing, insurance, and extended warranties. The company was considering a US IPO in 2024 at a $10.5 billion valuation.",

The company is using CRISPR gene-editing technology to bring back extinct species including the woolly mammoth (target: 2028), Tasmanian tiger (thylacine), and dodo bird. In January 2025, Colossal raised $200M at a $10.2B valuation, becoming Texas' first decacorn. The company has over 170 scientists across facilities in Dallas, Boston, and Melbourne, and has spun out two companies: Form Bio ($30M for computational biology) and Breaking ($10.5M for plastic degradation). Colossal's technologies have applications beyond de-extinction including artificial wombs, species preservation, and human healthcare.",

CFS is developing SPARC, a compact tokamak designed to demonstrate net energy gain (Q>1) by 2027, and ARC, the world's first grid-scale commercial fusion power plant planned for Virginia in the early 2030s. The company has raised nearly $3 billion - about one-third of all private fusion investment globally - from investors including Google, NVIDIA, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. In 2025, CFS signed landmark power purchase agreements with Google (200 MW) and Eni ($1B), and received $15M from the DOE Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. CFS's high-temperature superconducting magnet technology has proven commercially viable, putting them on track to deliver fusion energy this decade.",

At its peak, Cruise achieved a $30 billion valuation with investments from Microsoft, Honda, and institutional investors. However, after accumulating over $10 billion in operating losses and a critical 2023 incident where a pedestrian was dragged by a Cruise vehicle in San Francisco, GM announced in December 2024 it would exit the robotaxi business entirely. The company lost its California operating permits, laid off 900 employees, and cancelled its custom Origin robotaxi vehicle. GM is now integrating Cruise's technology into its personal vehicle ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) development, expecting to save $1 billion annually.",
