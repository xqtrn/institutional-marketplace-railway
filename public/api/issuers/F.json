The company is developing general-purpose humanoid robots designed to address global labor shortages in warehousing, logistics, and manufacturing. Figure assembled its team from robotics experts from Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Google DeepMind, and Apple. In September 2025, Figure exceeded $1 billion in Series C funding at a $39 billion post-money valuation, making it one of the most valuable robotics startups in history. The company partnered with BMW for real-world testing at their Spartanburg plant, where Figure 02 robots demonstrated 400% speed improvements and 7x success rate gains in manufacturing tasks.",
