Originally started as Google's Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo became a standalone company in 2016. The company operates Waymo One, the world's first commercial autonomous ride-hailing service, across 5 US cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. As of April 2025, Waymo provides 250,000+ paid rides per week (over 1 million miles monthly) with a fleet of 2,500 robotaxis. In November 2025, Waymo became the first US company to offer fully autonomous freeway rides at up to 65 mph. In October 2024, Waymo raised $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation, with backing from Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Tiger Global, and Silver Lake. Expansion to Miami, San Diego, Washington D.C., Tokyo, and London planned for 2026.",

    "overview": "Wayve is a British autonomous driving technology company founded in 2017 by Alex Kendall and Amar Shah, two machine learning PhD students from the University of Cambridge. The company pioneers Embodied AI for self-driving vehicles, using end-to-end deep learning that enables vehicles to learn from experience rather than relying on detailed maps or hand-coded rules. Unlike traditional autonomous vehicle systems that depend on expensive LiDAR sensors and high-definition maps, Wayve's approach uses primarily camera data and AI that can adapt to new environments without geofenced limits. The company was the first to deploy end-to-end deep learning autonomous vehicles on public roads. Headquartered in London with offices in California, Vancouver, Germany, and Japan, Wayve has raised over $1.3 billion from investors including SoftBank, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber. The company is currently in talks to raise an additional $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation. Wayve's vision is to create a \"general purpose\" driving AI that can power all levels of automation in any vehicle, anywhere in the world.",
