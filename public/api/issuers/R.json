    "overview": "Ripple Labs, Inc. is an American technology company founded in 2012 that focuses on blockchain-based payment solutions for financial institutions. The company develops RippleNet, a global payments network, and maintains the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. After a landmark SEC lawsuit that concluded in August 2025 with a $50 million settlement (reduced from $125M), Ripple raised $500 million in November 2025 at a $40 billion valuation—its first major fundraising in six years. The company initiated a $700 million share buyback in June 2025 at $25 billion implied valuation. Ripple launched the RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024, which exceeded $1 billion market cap by November 2025. Multiple spot XRP ETFs have been approved following the SEC settlement.",
