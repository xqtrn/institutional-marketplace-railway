After facing an SEC lawsuit and loss of banking access in June 2023, the exchange operated crypto-only until February 2025 when USD services were restored under interim CEO Norman Reed, a former SEC enforcement attorney. In May 2025, the SEC formally dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice, marking a major victory for the platform. Binance.US maintains a 73-person team in Palo Alto and continues rebuilding banking relationships while expanding its product suite.",

    "overview": "Bird Global was a pioneering electric scooter sharing company founded in 2017 by former Lyft and Uber executive Travis VanderZanden. The company was a leader in the micromobility revolution, deploying shared e-scooters in cities worldwide. Bird went public via SPAC merger in late 2021 at a valuation exceeding $2 billion, but faced mounting losses and declining ridership. The company's market cap dropped from $2B to $70M within 12 months of its NYSE debut. After exiting unprofitable markets, laying off 23% of staff, and multiple CEO changes, Bird filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2023. The company secured $25M in DIP financing from MidCap Financial and sought to sell its assets through a bankruptcy auction process.",

Bitmain filed for a $1 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2018 at a $15 billion valuation, but the application lapsed in March 2019 amid Bitcoin price concerns and internal power struggles between co-founders. The company has expanded into AI chips through subsidiary Sophgo, though that entity was placed on the US Entity List in January 2025. Bitmain has made 45 investments in blockchain companies and continues to lead ASIC innovation with next-generation liquid-cooled miners developed with Hut 8.",

Founded in 1992 as a spin-off from MIT by Marc Raibert, the company has created some of the most sophisticated robots ever built, including the humanoid Atlas, the quadruped Spot, and the warehouse robot Stretch. In 2021, Hyundai Motor Group acquired 80% of Boston Dynamics for $880 million. In 2024, the company unveiled an all-electric version of Atlas, significantly stronger with a broader range of motion. In April 2025, Hyundai announced plans to deploy 'tens of thousands' of Boston Dynamics robots across its manufacturing facilities as part of a $21 billion US investment. Boston Dynamics also partnered with Toyota Research Institute to develop general-purpose humanoid robots using large behavior models.",

However, a combination of mounting losses exceeding $1 billion annually, aggressive expansion, regulatory scrutiny, and investor conflicts led to a dramatic collapse. In July 2024, the NCLT initiated insolvency proceedings after BCCI filed a petition over unpaid dues. The founder's net worth plummeted from $2.1 billion to zero according to Forbes. In November 2025, a US court ordered Raveendran to pay over $1.07 billion related to alleged fund diversions, marking one of the most spectacular corporate collapses in Indian startup history.",

    "overview": "BYTON was a Chinese-German electric vehicle startup founded in 2017 by former BMW and Nissan executives with ambitious plans to revolutionize smart mobility. The company garnered significant attention at CES 2018 with its M-Byte concept featuring a massive 48-inch curved dashboard display. Backed by China FAW Group, CATL, Foxconn, and other major investors, BYTON raised over $1 billion and reached a valuation near $2 billion. However, repeated production delays, internal turmoil, executive departures, and financial difficulties led to suspended operations in 2020 and eventual bankruptcy in 2023. Despite partnerships with Foxconn and substantial government backing from Nanjing, the M-Byte never reached mass production, making BYTON one of the most prominent casualties of China's EV startup shakeout that saw over 400 EV companies cease operations between 2018 and 2025.",
