Founded by Sreeram Kannan, the protocol has grown from $1.1B to over $18B in total value locked throughout 2024, representing 85%+ of the overall restaking market. EigenLayer's innovation enables the creation of 'Actively Validated Services' (AVS) that can leverage Ethereum's security without bootstrapping their own validator set. The EIGEN token launched in October 2024 at approximately $6.7 billion fully diluted valuation.",
