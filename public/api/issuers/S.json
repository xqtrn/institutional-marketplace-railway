The company has become the world's largest fast-fashion retailer with 18% global market share, generating $38 billion in revenue in 2024 (up 23% YoY). Shein's AI-driven supply chain enables it to go from design to production in 3-7 days, adding thousands of new styles daily. The company has struggled with IPO plans—after failing to gain SEC approval for a US listing, Shein filed with the London Stock Exchange in June 2024, gaining FCA approval in April 2025. In mid-2025, Shein also filed for a Hong Kong IPO. Net profit fell 40% in 2024 to ~$1 billion due to increased competition from Temu and rising tariffs affecting the de minimis exemption.",

The company pioneered the shift-left security movement. Snyk reached $300M ARR in October 2024 with 5,000+ enterprise customers and is targeting cash-flow positive in 2025. The company's AI-native SAST product (Snyk Code) alone generates $100M ARR. While Snyk reached an $8.5B valuation in 2021, recent valuations have compressed. In November 2024, Snyk acquired Probely for dynamic application security testing.",

(SSI) is an AI research company co-founded by Ilya Sutskever, Daniel Gross, and Daniel Levy in June 2024 with a singular mission: building safe superintelligence. Sutskever, a legendary figure in AI who co-founded OpenAI and led the development of GPT models, became CEO in July 2025 after Gross departed for Meta. SSI reached a staggering $32 billion valuation in April 2025 after raising $2 billion led by Greenoaks Capital—a 6.4x valuation increase from its $5B September 2024 round. The company has raised $3 billion total from Alphabet, NVIDIA, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, DST Global, and Lightspeed. Operating with only ~20 employees, SSI has no products, no revenue, and no commercial ambitions—it exists solely to solve the superintelligence alignment problem. In April 2025, Google Cloud announced a partnership to provide TPUs for SSI's research.",
