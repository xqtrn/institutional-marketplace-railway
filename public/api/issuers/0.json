The company achieved unicorn status ($1B valuation) in just eight months—one of the fastest in AI history. 01.AI's Yi series models consistently rank among the top open-source LLMs globally, with Yi-Lightning surpassing GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to rank #6 worldwide and #1 in China on LMSYS benchmarks. Notable for training world-class models with just 2,000 GPUs at $3M cost (2% of competitors). In January 2025, 01.AI formed a joint industrial AI lab with Alibaba Cloud to develop enterprise solutions. The company generated ¥100M revenue in 2024 and is pivoting to B2B AI solutions leveraging DeepSeek and other open models.",
