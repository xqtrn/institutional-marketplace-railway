    "overview": "Discord is a communication platform founded in 2015 by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevsky. Originally designed for gamers, Discord has expanded to serve communities across education, crypto, music, and more. The platform reaches over 200 million monthly users across 60,000+ game titles (1.5B hours of gameplay monthly). Discord raised $600M at $15B valuation in 2021 and generated $879M revenue in 2024. Microsoft attempted to acquire Discord for $12B in 2021 but the deal fell through. The company began testing ads in 2024 as it expands beyond gaming.",

The company emerged from stealth in October 2024 with Oasis, the first playable real-time AI open-world model that replicates Minecraft gameplay through next-frame prediction, trained on millions of hours of footage. Unlike OpenAI's Sora which takes 10-20 seconds per second of video, Decart generates 20 frames per second with zero latency. Founded by Robert Wachen (Harvard) and Dean Leitersdorf (Technion), the company reached 1 million users in just 3 days and has raised $53 million from Sequoia Capital and Benchmark.",

Founded in 2013 by Philip Kaplan (creator of FuckedCompany.com), the San Francisco-based company has revolutionized music distribution with its simple, affordable pricing model that lets artists keep 100% of their royalties. DistroKid reached a $1.3 billion valuation in 2021 and has grown to over 2 million artists with nearly $100 million in annual revenue by 2024. The platform processes over 3 million uploads per month and has paid out billions in royalties to independent artists. Unlike traditional distributors that charge per release, DistroKid charges a flat annual fee, making it the go-to platform for emerging musicians.",
